# Project Roadmap & Structural Blueprint

This document holds the **ORNS Charity Auction Manager**'s outstanding work: the verified bug/security/hardening backlog from the most recent code audit, followed by net-new feature milestones. When a backlog item is finished, remove it from this file entirely and record what happened in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) - this file only ever shows what's still outstanding, never a history of what's already done.

(The backlog used to live in `refactor-opportunities.md`; that file had gone stale - it reported Code Hardening as "fully closed" and its "Passed Audit Inspection" list cited files that no longer exist - so it was cleared on 2026-10-21 and this audit's findings were logged here instead.)

## ⚠️ DO THIS BEFORE THE AUCTION

**Test the cash/check surcharge removal against real PayPal (sandbox mode) at least once.** It's covered by unit tests that simulate PayPal's API, but has never been exercised against PayPal itself (see `CHANGELOG.md`'s L3 entry, `PayPalService.removeSurchargeLine` in `server/services/paypalService.ts`).

Steps:

1. Confirm the app is in PayPal sandbox mode (Config's `paypalIsSandbox`, or check the PayPal Integration tab in Settings).
2. Pick a test bidder who's won at least one item but hasn't checked out.
3. Print or email that bidder's receipt first, so a PayPal invoice exists for them (Checkout page, or Bidders page).
4. Log into the PayPal sandbox dashboard and find that invoice; note its total (it should include the processing fee).
5. In the app's Checkout page, mark that bidder paid with **Cash** (or **Check**).
6. If a yellow warning toast appears, the fee removal didn't go through cleanly - read what it says (it tells you what to do, e.g. mark the invoice paid by hand in PayPal) and note the wording so it can be looked into.
7. If no warning appears, refresh the invoice in the PayPal sandbox dashboard and confirm:
   - The processing-fee line item is gone.
   - The invoice total is now just the sum of the bidder's winning bids (no fee).
   - The invoice shows as **Paid**.
8. Once this works, remove this item and note the result in `CHANGELOG.md`.

If step 7 doesn't check out, cash/check checkouts will still work (the code falls back to recording the full fee-inclusive amount if the removal call fails) - but the bidder's invoice will keep showing the fee amount even though cash was collected without it. In that case let the dev know what happened in step 6/7 instead of using this feature for real auction checkouts yet.

## Feature Milestones (Staging)

### Webhooks with Fluent Forms

1. Look into implementing some kind of redundant feature to ensure that tickets don't get messed up.
